# Vaultspec Core CLI

This project is vaultspec-managed. See `vaultspec.builtin.md` for framework rules and
workflow concepts.

## Mandate

All `.vault/` reads, mutations, audits, and repairs route through `vaultspec-core`
owning-verb logic; never hand-write frontmatter, filenames, plan structure, or new
`.vault/` documents (editing scaffolded body prose is permitted, see "Allowed manual
edits"). The vaultspec MCP tools are the primary transport where the server is
connected, the `vaultspec-core` CLI verbs otherwise; both terminate in the same
owning-verb logic that enforces templates, taxonomy, wiki-links, and schema, so
bypassing it produces drift the `check` tool and `vaultspec-core spec doctor` will flag.

## Orientation

Orient before working in a project you have no session context for: the `status` tool
reports the in-flight plans and their next open Step, and the `find` tool locates the
documents and features behind them (CLI: `vaultspec-core status [TARGET]`). Orientation
is descriptive, read-only, and the zeroth move, not a pipeline phase.

## Tools and operations

The nine MCP tools cover the hot path by capability: `status` (orientation), `find`
(document and feature discovery), `create` (scaffold documents, batchable), `edit`
(body-prose edits, batchable), `plan_progress` (mark Steps checked or unchecked),
`plan_edit` (author and restructure Step rows), `check` (validate and repair), and the
`discover`/`invoke` gateway that reaches every remaining verb.

Operations without a first-class hot tool fall into two honest bands:

- **Gateway-only, CLI-first:** `sync`, `spec <resource> sync`, and the above-Step plan
  verbs (`tier promote/demote`, `wave`, `phase`, `epic intent`). The `discover`/`invoke`
  gateway also reaches these, but `invoke`'s destructive annotation forces host
  confirmation on every call, so the CLI is the better default even when connected.
- **CLI-only:** `vault feature index`, `spec mcps add/remove/sync`, and `uninstall` have
  no MCP path at all; run them through the CLI.

For anything else, the `discover` tool and the bundled CLI reference
(`.vaultspec/reference/cli.md`, locally resident) are the catalogs of every command,
option, argument, and exit code.

Where the vaultspec MCP server is not connected, the `vaultspec-core` CLI verbs carry
every operation; the bundled CLI reference is the catalog.

## CLI fallback

- Run `vaultspec-core <cmd>`, or `uv run --no-sync vaultspec-core <cmd>` in uv
  environments; `--target DIR`, `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--force`, and `<cmd> --help`
  cover targeting, previewing, and the full flag and exit-code reference.
- Sync-shaped results (`install`, `sync`, `spec <resource> sync`, `migrations run`) read
  with one vocabulary - `created`, `updated`, `unchanged`, `removed`, `restored`,
  `skipped`, `failed`; `unchanged` is a successful no-op, `skipped` carries a reason,
  only `failed` stops the pipeline.

## Allowed manual edits

Permitted: editing body prose of a document scaffolded through the `create` tool or
`vaultspec-core vault add`, and editing sources under `.vaultspec/rules/`, `skills/`,
`agents/`, `hooks/`, or `mcps/` followed by `vaultspec-core sync`. Forbidden:
hand-writing frontmatter, filenames, or new `.vault/` documents, and editing files
inside generated provider directories (`vaultspec-core sync` regenerates them).
