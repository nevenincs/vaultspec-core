<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace {feature} with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

<!-- PHASE SUMMARY:
     This file rolls up every <Step Record> belonging to one Phase
     of the originating plan. Each Step (S##) in the Phase produces
     one <Step Record> in `.vault/exec/`; this summary aggregates
     them, lists modified / created files across the Phase, and
     reports verification status. -->

# `{feature}` `{phase}` summary

<!-- Brief summary of overall progress across every Step in this Phase,
     followed by a list of files touched across the Phase, e.g.:
     - Modified: `{file1}`
     - Created: `{file2}` -->
