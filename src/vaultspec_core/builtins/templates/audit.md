<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #audit) and one feature tag.
     Replace {feature} with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar]]'.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

# `{feature}` audit: `{title}`

## Scope

<!-- What was audited and why -->

## Findings

<!-- Key findings organized by severity -->

## Recommendations

<!-- Actionable recommendations -->

## Codification candidates

<!-- Findings that satisfy the three durability criteria
(cross-session, constraint-shaped, project-bound) and should be
promoted into project-shared rules under `.vaultspec/rules/rules/`
(the directory the CLI's `vaultspec-core spec rules add` writes to today; the
planned `--scope project` flag will move authored rules under
`.vaultspec/rules/rules/project/`).

Each candidate names the finding it derives from, the proposed
rule slug (kebab-case, naming the constraint's subject not the
failure), and a one-sentence statement of the rule.

Most audits produce zero codification candidates. Some produce one.
Only the rare framework-wide-pattern audit produces several. If
none of the findings above meet the bar, state that explicitly and
move on -- an empty Codification candidates section is a positive
signal, not a failure. -->

<!-- Example:

- **Source:** finding S04 (destructive verbs lack preview).
  **Rule slug:** `destructive-verbs-need-dry-run`.
  **Rule:** Every CLI verb that writes or removes state must
  accept `--dry-run` and emit a usable preview before applying.
